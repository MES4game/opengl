# Skeleton code for PyOpenGL

This is the skeleton code for creating graphics applications using OpenGL and Python.


## Installation

You would need some libraries in your machine. To install them, simply run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Run the Application

To launch the window, simply run (while in the same directory as this file):
```bash
python3 main.py
```


## TODO

- [ ] `src/renderer.py` and `src/shapes/shape.py`: implement a sun (instead of using the player as light source)
- [ ] `src/*` and `main.py`: complete every docstrings
- [ ] `src/*` and `main.py`: add comment inside functions/methods
- [ ] `src/camera.py`: implement every camera type
- [ ] `src/*` and `main.py`: find and complete every `# TODO`
- [ ] `README.md`: rework the README
